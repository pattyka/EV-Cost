            <p>EV Cost does not collect or share any data. Everything stays on your device. The only data processed is when you save a value as “default,” which is stored locally and never leaves your device:)</p>

            <h2>Privacy Policy for EV Cost</h2>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025.01.13 (policy is prone to change)</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>This Privacy Policy provides an in-depth explanation of how EV Cost ("the App") manages user data. At EV Cost, we prioritize your privacy and ensure that no data is collected, shared, or processed beyond what is strictly necessary for the App's functionality. This document outlines our commitment to privacy, describing how user preferences are managed and stored locally on your device.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h4>Scope of Data Handling</h4>
            <p><strong>No Data Collection:</strong> EV Cost does not collect, track, or transmit any data from its users. The App operates entirely offline, and no information is sent to external servers, third-party services, or analytics platforms.</p>
            <p><strong>Local Data Processing Only:</strong> The App processes a minimal amount of data, strictly limited to enhancing user experience. Specifically: 
                <ul>
                    <li>User preferences, such as saved default values, are stored locally on the user’s device.</li>
                    <li>This storage enables the App to remember user settings and improve usability without requiring re-entry of information during subsequent sessions.</li>
                </ul>
            This data is neither shared with third parties nor accessible outside of the device.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h4>How Data Is Stored Locally</h4>
            <p>The App uses local storage mechanisms provided by the iOS operating system to save user preferences. This ensures the data remains confined to the device, offering a secure and private experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Characteristics of Local Storage:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device-Confined:</strong> All saved preferences are tied to the user’s device and cannot be accessed externally.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> User preferences remain available across App sessions for convenience but can be reset or deleted by the user at any time.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Data stored locally is protected by the inherent security measures of the iOS ecosystem, such as encryption and user authentication.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            
            <h4>Privacy by Design</h4>
            <p>EV Cost is built with privacy as a core principle. Our design philosophy includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minimal Data Handling:</strong> The App processes only what is essential for its functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>No External Communication:</strong> The App does not connect to the internet for data transmission.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency and User Control:</strong> Users have full control over their locally stored data. Deleting the App removes all associated data.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            
            <h4>Third-Party Services</h4>
            <p>EV Cost does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising platforms. Your data remains entirely within the App, and no external entities are involved in its processing.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h4>Security</h4>
            <p><strong>Reliance on iOS Security Measures:</strong> The App leverages Apple’s secure environment to safeguard user preferences stored on the device. Key protections include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Data saved locally is encrypted and accessible only within the App.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> The App does not permit external access to stored preferences.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Since EV Cost does not transmit or share data, risks associated with external breaches are entirely mitigated.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h4>User Control and Data Retention</h4>
            <p><strong>Control Over Preferences:</strong> Users have complete control over their locally stored preferences. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Saving Default Values:</strong> Users can save default preferences for convenience.</li>
                <li><strong>Resetting Data:</strong> All locally stored preferences can be reset by uninstalling the App, which removes all associated data.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Data Retention Policy:</strong> Preferences saved locally are retained indefinitely for user convenience unless:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The user deletes the data manually (if the App provides a reset option).</li>
                <li>The App is uninstalled, which clears all locally stored information.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            
            <h4>Updates to This Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or compliance with evolving legal standards. Any updates will be made available within the App or its associated website/documentation. Users are encouraged to review the Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.</p>
